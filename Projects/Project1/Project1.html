        <h2>Pitchfork — <a href="https://pitchfork.com/">https://pitchfork.com/</a></h2>

        <p><strong>1.</strong> My first impression of this website was actually kinda impressed! I was thinking that the sites you were going to have listed were all going to be horrible sites and so when I saw the site I was suprised. It looks like a very common website format that I have seen before. </p>

        <p><strong>2.</strong> Regarding information flow, the site has a very long scrolling screen in each tab filled with a lot of information and different articles.</p>

        <p><strong>3.</strong> The site structure is well organized into categories with the tabs in the top middle, but it has so much information within each tab that isn't well structured that ends up being confusing.</p>

        <p><strong>4.</strong> In terms of multimedia and graphics there are many different photos all really meant to grab my attention, but it created the opposite affect for me. Instead, with there being so many pictures and clickbait things, I got a bit of Ad blindness and instead ignored all of them together. </p>

        <p><strong>5.</strong> The home page loaded almost instantly.</p>

        <p><strong>6.</strong> The readability of the text is very easy. Almost all the words are black on white background, or vice versa.</p>

        <p><strong>7.</strong> For navigation, the site provides a few different tabs in the top of the page to direct through categories, that is helpful, I would only wish that it would scroll so that I could refer to it easier. </p>

        <p><strong>8.</strong> The visual consistency and color scheme of the website was great. It is mostly black and white which is formal and seems professional. </p>

        <p><strong>9.</strong> When resizing the browser window to a smaller size nothing resized with it. There was no way to read or comprehend the page when it was smaller.</p>

        <p><strong>10.</strong> One aspect of this site that was particularly well done is how there are multiple different scrolling sections to make the page feel less like one really long screen and more like we are actually interacting with it.</p>
